# LongHair-GenderDetection

## Overview
This project is part of the NullClass Internship July 2025.  
It classifies gender based on facial images with a logical twist:

- If the person is aged between **20 and 30**, the prediction is influenced by **hair length**:
  - Long hair → predicted as **Female**
  - Short hair → predicted as **Male**
- For all other age ranges, gender is predicted **normally using the model**.


## Model Highlights
- CNN-based custom model trained on **UTKFace Dataset**
- Achieves ~80% accuracy
- Age and hair logic implemented using image filename parsing and rules
- GUI built using **Gradio** to test predictions interactively
